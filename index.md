Hyde Park Ultimate
------------------

We're a friendly community game of pick-up ultimate centered in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, IL. During warm months we play at Promontory Point park on Sunday starting at 2pm.

Whether you're new to town or new to ultimate we encourage you to come by. All you need to bring is comfortable running gear and a good spirit.

### Details

-   **Who:** We are a collections of friends, friends of friends, strangers on the internet, and passersby who all love to play ultimate.

-   **What:** An awesome ultimate pickup game

-   **When:** Every Sunday afternoon

-   **When exactly?:** Traditionally 2pm, but during the winter we're a bit flexible for people's schedules. Check the [e-mail list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hpfrisbee) for announcements.

-   **Where:** We play at [Beautiful Promontory Point Park](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Promontory+Point+Park,+5491+S+South+Shore+Dr,+Chicago,+IL+60615&hl=en&ll=41.795824,-87.5776&spn=0.024476,0.038581&sll=41.794403,-87.584182&sspn=0.012238,0.01929&oq=promontory&hq=Promontory+Point+Park,+5491+S+South+Shore+Dr,+Chicago,+IL+60615&radius=15000&t=m&z=15), roughly 55th South and the Lake. Despite being relatively far south we're oddly well connected to downtown. Both the \#6 and Metra Electric Train stop a couple blocks away. If you're driving we're very close to the 53rd street exit on Lake Shore Drive 

-   **Level of play:** We have a broad skill range. Some of our players are just learning to throw forehand, others have played in national tournaments. We try to keep the atmosphere energetic but not super competitive. In general we don't keep score, do force, don't stack, count stalls only on players who don't get stressed by it and always cheer the other team. We encourage new players to come out, we'll pit you against other new players.

-   **Awesome pictures of us:** One of our members happens to be a professional photographer. He has put up some lovely [pictures on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danieljbutler/sets/72157628802174869/).

-   **Contact:** We send out e-mails via a [listhost](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hpfrisbee). You can also contact [one of our players](mailto:matt_rocklin@yahoo.com) for more information.

### FAQ

-   **Q**: Hi! I'm a recent transplant from \_\_\_\_. Do you still have a game on Sundays? 

    **A**: As of June 2013, yes, we do. I anticipate we'll have a game every weekend unless there is heavy rain (and even then you never know).
-   **Q**: I'm just here for the Summer. Is it ok that I join?

    **A**: Absolutely - also, you won't be alone. Lots of interns/summer students play with us just for the season. It's also a great way to meet people in Chicago.
